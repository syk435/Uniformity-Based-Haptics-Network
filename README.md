# Uniformity-Based-Haptics-Network
A common infrastructure to foster intercommunication among haptics-utilizing device groups. The main goal of this intercommunication would be to produce a more “polite”  and intuitive haptics user experience for a user who has multiple haptics enabled master/slave device groups

We intend to create a common infrastructure to foster intercommunication among haptics-utilizing device groups. The main goal of this intercommunication would be to produce a more “polite”  and intuitive haptics user experience for a user who has multiple haptics enabled master/slave device groups. This will be done through:
Turn-based “polite” system that will prevent all of a user’s device from simultaneously bombarding the user with haptic info/notifications, but rather promote a natural and intelligent succession of haptics interactions that promote user comfort
Implement uniform vibration “levels” by accounting for density of material each haptic group is currently placed on/in, and adjusting vibration levels as needed to produce more pleasant and uniform haptics experience as device placements change
